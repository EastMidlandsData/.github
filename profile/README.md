We're a community run Microsoft focused data user group. We provide free training, socialising, networking, recruitment, geeky debate and more on a wide range of data technology topics to anyone who wants to come along to our meetings.

Our **in-person** events run on the **second Wednesday of every month**.

To cover as much of the East Midlands as possible we currently alternate locations between **Nottingham** and **Derby**.
